## Ariel Attacking Tool
### Overview

Ariel Attacking Tool is a Python-based GUI application designed for educational purposes to demonstrate and simulate different types of network attacks. It integrates functionalities for launching HTTP Flood, SYN Flood, and UDP Flood attacks to specified IP addresses using a user-defined number of threads. The application is built using tkinter for the GUI component, threading for concurrent attacks, and socket programming for network communication.
Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    tkinter (usually comes with Python)
    Access to command-line/terminal

Steps

    Clone the repository or download the source code:

bash

git clone https://github.com/KuberCaptain/Cybersecurity/ari-bomber.py

    Ensure Python and tkinter are installed on your system. You can verify the installation of Python and tkinter by running:

bash

python --version
python -m tkinter

If tkinter is installed, a small window will appear. You can close it and proceed.
Usage

To run the Ariel Attacking Tool, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute:

bash

python attack_tool.py

This command will open the GUI of the Ariel Attacking Tool. Follow the steps below to use the application:

    Enter the IP address of the target: Provide the IP address you wish to attack.
    Enter the number of threads to use: Specify the number of concurrent threads for the attack.
    Choose the attack type: Select the type of attack you want to launch from the dropdown menu (HTTP Flood, SYN Flood, UDP Flood).
    Launch Attack: Click the "Launch Attack" button to start the attack.

### Features

    Multiple Attack Types: Supports HTTP Flood, SYN Flood, and UDP Flood attacks.
    Threaded Execution: Utilizes threading to execute multiple instances of the attack simultaneously.
    Simple GUI: Easy-to-use graphical interface for setting up and launching attacks.
